# **Growth Mindset**


 - From my point of view, this type of mind set is not only being able to learn, view, and understand new things from only your perspective but of others as well and have the willingness to push your self and get what needs to be done with the highest of quality that you and others can be proud of. 
    
    * 1 reminder: Don't give up, push your self to learn and to problem solve in a timely fahsion
    * 2 reminder: Pay Attention!! Don't lose focus and keep going until the job is done, or you fall dead asleep :+1:.
    * 3 reminder: Look ahead to the future, the struggles of now are only temporary, persevere with dilligence.

#### What you see above is typical coding found in most if not all html coded sites. Notices how it works like a sentence, using special characters for grammer and spaces for punctuation and formatting. This all combines together to bring countless lines of codes to be processed by hardware and programms used all around the world in almost anything that involvles technology.
