What is a variable?
A variable is a container that holds a piece of information  

Example: var userName = promt('What is your name?');


## Datatypes

- **string** = 'text', or ""text"" 
- **number** = 45, 23 , 11 ,2 , any number 
- **=,==,==** = is an assignment operator, == is an equal, === is an strict equal. Good practice is using the triple equal, double equal can lead to injections   
- **Boolean** - this can either be true or false. 1 or 0
