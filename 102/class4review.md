# Class 4 Review  


## HTML & Wireframe  

- Foundation
- Using structure made it easier
- Using Live server made checking changes much easier in real time
- Wireframe and labels helped make the website and give plans for the foundation 
- Wireframe is the foundation and direction of what you are going to do

 <body> - Everything that you want showing up in the page must be in the body, except for the tittle.
<!DOCTYPE html> - Tells the browser what it is reading and the version of HTML to expect
<head> - Title, link to css, meta, and sizeing date goes here

3 areas in the body> header, main, footer. Each syntax is like a container, use the right syntax that makes sense for proper symantic html
