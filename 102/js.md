# Java Script

JS is the muscle for the page, this is what allows the page to be functional. It can store variables, iterate through arrays. It act more like a programming language. 

Variables =  this temporary storage of something

var name = 'Roger'

name = 'Stacy'
console.log(name + ' is your instructor');

Stacy is your instructor 


## Objects and Methods

**document.write('Good Afternoon!')**

The above is a line in JavaScript and hows how to use objest and methods. 

**document** - this is the object on the line.
**.** - this is the member operator, helps find methods and properties of the object beforehand
**write** - this the method/ or could be a property as well if chosen
**('Text')** - this is the parameter, methods need information in this field in order to work

<script></script> - When a browser comes across a script, it stops and loads the script and then checks if it needs to do anything. Scripts will come out on the page wherever you place it in the html file. Scripts can also affect loading times for pages.
