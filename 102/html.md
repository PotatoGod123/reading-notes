    - Hypertext Markup Language

index.html - This is standard file type for websites

## Information

    - Used in conjuction with css and javascript to provide a fully flesh website and allows you to create sturcture for paragraphs and headings

## Process & Design

    - It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return and how often they do
    - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site
    - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page
    -  Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
    - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
    - You can use grouping(how they are sorted and put together) and similarity(what size,font, color and style that have in comon) to help simplify the information.

Website first to go up is HTML = Foundations
Add CSS to make the site look good = Structure
JS - makes the site functional = Internal Functions
