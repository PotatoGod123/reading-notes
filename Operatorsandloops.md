# Operators
**==** - Is equal to  
**!=** - is not equal to  
warining, try not to use the two above, not safe or best practice.   
**===**-strict equal to   
**!==**-Strick not equal to  
Always better to use strick equals operators!  
**>**-greater than operator  
**<**- Less than operator  
**>=**- greater than or equalt to operator  
**<=**- less than or equal to operator  

## Logical Operators  

**&&**- Logical and, this test more than one condition. Both condition must be true for it to return ture  
**||**- Logical or, this test at least one condition. Either expression can be true or false and will return in true, but if both are false, it will return false.  
**!**- Logical not, this takes a single boolean value and inverts it. It makes whatever you put ! infront reverse. Example !true returns false. !false returns true  


## Loops  

**for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {**
    **documment.write(i);**
**}**  

**for**- The keyword  
**(var i=0; i<10; i++)**- The condition(counter)  
    - **var i=0;**- this is the initialization, sometimes you'll see it be made right before the loops is made  
    - **i < 0**- this is the condition  
    -**i++**- Update, Every time the loop runs the statement in the curly brackets it will add one to the counter  
**{documment.write(i);}**- code to execute during loop  

The above is an example and a common loop. you can use three keywords for a loop  
    - **for**- Use this keyword if you need run a loop a certain amount of times since you can tell it to run how many times you need it to run.  
    - **while**- If you do not know how many times it needs to run, use this keyword for a loop and it will keep looping till as long the condition is true.  
    - **do while**- This is similar to while but it will run whatever is in the codeblock at least once even if the condition comes out false.  

**+=** - Allows you to add the statement from it's past loops
