# Java

## For Loop  

A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.  

## While Loop  

The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.  

## Do-WHile Loop  

The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
