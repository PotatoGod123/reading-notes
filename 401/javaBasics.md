## Variables  

Essentially it is a field or variable that you name while iniializing a value.

Use this to read more indept on what kinds of variables exits.

Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.

Use this to see a table of operators and what they do.

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks  

An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution. A  block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed. 

## Control Flow Statements  

The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code. This section describes the decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), the looping statements (for, while, do-while), and the branching statements (break, continue, return) supported by the Java programming language.
