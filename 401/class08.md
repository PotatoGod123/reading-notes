## Object-oriented design  

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles.  

SOLID stands for:

    S - Single-responsiblity Principle
    O - Open-closed Principle
    L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    I - Interface Segregation Principle
    D - Dependency Inversion Principle  
  
Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:

    A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
  
  
Open-closed Principle (S.R.P.) states:

    Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

  
Liskov Substitution Principle states:

    Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.  

Interface Segregation Principle  

Interface segregation principle states:

    A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.  



Interface Segregation Principle  

Interface segregation principle states:

    A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
