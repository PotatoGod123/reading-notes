## Upgrade your techinical skills

The highest rate of learning is at the beggining of your career. That's when you spend hours trying to figure whatever it is your are doing and trying to fix the problems till you have something that works. The key is that you have to **force** your self to learn push through it. 

The key ideas behind deliberate practice is that it:  

- Pushes you just outside your comfort zone
- Repeated often
- Feedback on results in continuously available
- It's highly demanding mentally
- It's difficult
- It requires good goals  

Whatever challenges you settle on, they need to be repeated often. Much of the benefit of learning a new technique or skill is the ability to apply it in novel situations. The challenges have to push you just outside your comfort zone. It's no use trying to solve a complex problem in code if you can't yet iterate over an array. The gap in your knowledge that the challenge forces you to overcome needs to be surmountable.
Set yourself a small, finishable challenge that teaches you something further outside your comfort zone instead.
