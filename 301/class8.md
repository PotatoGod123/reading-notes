## SQL

Essentially SQL is a host of a bunch of data bases being able to scale up to hold millions of information tables. The way the data is set up is  like a  table of data in an excell each, with columns showing the title of said information and the rows being said data information. 

using this  

```Javascript
SELECT *
FROM tableName
``` 

Will allow you to get all the data from whatever database you specifiy.  


**Operator** 	                      **Condition** 	                                **SQL Example**
=, !=, < <=, >, >= 	        Standard numerical operators 	                        col_name != 4
BETWEEN … AND … 	          Number is within range of two values (inclusive)    	col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5
NOT BETWEEN … AND … 	      Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) 	col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10
IN (…) 	                    Number exists in a list 	                            col_name IN (2, 4, 6)
NOT IN (…) 	                Number does not exist in a list 	                    col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)



These operator allow you to use the **WHERE** condifiton with more condition.
