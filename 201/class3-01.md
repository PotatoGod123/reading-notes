# Pre-Notes

## CSS

You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site, like a gallery. Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS. You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box. You can create image rollover effecs by moving the background position of an image. To reduce the number of images your broswer has to load, you can create image sprites.  

``` CSS
background-image: url("image here");
background-repeat:no-repeat;
background-postion: center top;
```

this will also you to position the background image but it msut have an no repeat.  

These are the combinations you can have for the position, if onyl value is used then the second will always be center  

- left top  

- left center  

- left bottom  

- center top  

- center center  

- center bottom  

- right top  

- right center  

- right bottom  

Using the :hover and :active after a selctor allows you to change the style of it when hovering or clicked. Used with buttons  



## Web browser tools

Search engine optimization(SEO) helps visitors find your sites when using search engines. Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there. To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting. FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server. Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters,  e-commerce and other popular website tools ( to save you writing them from scratch).
