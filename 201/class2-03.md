## CSS  

### Layout  

css treats every element as its own box, it will go as an block-level box or an inline box  

block-level elements  
```<h1><p><ul><li>```  
inline-elements  
```<img><b><i>```  

Highly recommend you make a div element to group up elements that go usually in one area. Not only that to it's tend to be better to wireframe first so you can easily vision and program the correct way you would want your website to work in css. Using pixels measure will usually make a website be more fixed in the way it appears while using percent will make it more liquid and fit to any size of the browser keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide and show what the main site is about within the top 600 pixel of the field vision box.
