## CSS  







```CSS
div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}
```  

Notice how the un prefixed transform is at the bottom just incase the browser does support, it will then overide the other properies set.
