## Domain Modeling

Use this [link](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling) to re-read domain modeling.

Essential is making a conceptual model in code for a specific problem, usually used to show other people and well articulated model and show and verify easily by both technical and business teams.


## HTML

### Tables

```<table></table>``` this element is used to create a table
```<tr></tr>``` this element goes inside the table element and makes a row of the table
```<td></td>``` this element goes inside the row element, it represent the cell of each row in the table
```<th></th>``` this elemet goes in the tr like the td but is used to make headings for rows or columns 

```<thead></thead>```
```<tbody></tbody>```
```<tfoot></tfoot>```   these don't really do much but can be used to organize a table and for css purposes as well

## JavaScript


### Funtions, Methods & Objects

Funcstions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. Functions can also take parameters(information required to do thier job) and may return a value.  
An object is a series of variables and functions of variables and functions that represet something from the world around you. In an object, variables are know as properties of the object; functions are know as methods of the object. Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window. JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.  
Arrays and object can be used to create complex data sets(and both can contain the other!!)
